  abstract  = {The GeoSteiner software package has for about 20 years been the fastest (publicly available) program for computing exact solutions to Steiner tree problems in the plane. The computational study by Warme, Winter and Zachariasen, published in 2000, documented the performance of the GeoSteiner approach—allowing the exact solution of Steiner tree problems with more than a thousand terminals. Since then, a number of algorithmic enhancements have improved the performance of the software package significantly. We describe these (previously unpublished) enhancements, and present a new computational study wherein we run the current code on the largest problem instances from the 2000-study, and on a number of larger problem instances. The computational study is performed using the commercial GeoSteiner 4.0 code base, and the performance is compared to the publicly available GeoSteiner 3.1 code base as well as the code base from the 2000-study. The software studied in the paper is being released as GeoSteiner 5.0 under an open source license.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Euclidean Steiner tree problem asks for a shortest network interconnecting a set of terminals in the plane. Over the last decade, the maximum problem size solvable within 1 h (for randomly generated problem instances) has increased from 10 to approximately 50 terminals. We present a new exact algorithm, called geosteiner96. It has several algorithmic modifications which improve both the generation and the concatenation of full Steiner trees. On average, geosteiner96 solves randomly generated problem instances with 50 terminals in less than 2 min and problem instances with 100 terminals in less than 8 min. In addition to computational results for randomly generated problem instances, we present computational results for (perturbed) regular lattice instances and public library instances. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
