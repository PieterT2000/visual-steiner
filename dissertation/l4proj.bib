  abstract = {The history of the Euclidean Steiner tree problem, which is the problem of constructing a shortest possible network interconnecting a set of given points in the Euclidean plane, goes back to Gergonne in the early nineteenth century. We present a detailed account of the mathematical contributions of some of the earliest papers on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. Furthermore, we link these initial contributions with results from the recent literature on the problem.},

  title     = {The GeoSteiner software package for computing Steiner trees in the plane: an updated computational study},
  abstract  = {The GeoSteiner software package has for about 20 years been the fastest (publicly available) program for computing exact solutions to Steiner tree problems in the plane. The computational study by Warme, Winter and Zachariasen, published in 2000, documented the performance of the GeoSteiner approachâ€”allowing the exact solution of Steiner tree problems with more than a thousand terminals. Since then, a number of algorithmic enhancements have improved the performance of the software package significantly. We describe these (previously unpublished) enhancements, and present a new computational study wherein we run the current code on the largest problem instances from the 2000-study, and on a number of larger problem instances. The computational study is performed using the commercial GeoSteiner 4.0 code base, and the performance is compared to the publicly available GeoSteiner 3.1 code base as well as the code base from the 2000-study. The software studied in the paper is being released as GeoSteiner 5.0 under an open source license.},
